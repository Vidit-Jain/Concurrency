- 4 entities, 4 types of threads?
- (Remember enigma's strat, make diff entities for H, A, N stands)
- Maybe keep a semaphore for each zone?
- Keep a cond variable for each person. Trigger that person if a goal is scored, or that he needs to leave
- Whenever a goal is scored, check if any of the spectators are enraged
- Whenever a second has past, check if any of the spectators have spent too much time, and that they must leave

Use cond timedwait in the spectator.
If they didn't get a seat make them leave

When a person is done with watching, he exits
he signals the semaphore for the zone, and leaves

create multiple threads for each home, neutral spectator, each thread holds the proper zone semaphore
once a thread receives a signal, it locks that spectator, and checks if the zone variable of the spectator is
equal to 0. If not, then that means he sat somewhere else, so terminate the thread

In the thread, after sitting down, first check if the goals are fine, if not then exit immediately
put a condition variable, to be called by the timer interrupt and the goal interrupt whenever he's sat for too much
time or the number of goals have exceeded and he is enraged.
